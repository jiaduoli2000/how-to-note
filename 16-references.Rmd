\[2\] The research on willpower or “ego depletion” is in a bit of turmoil at the moment. But it is safe to say that using willpower is a terrible strategy to get things done in the long run. For an overview:https://replicationindex.wordpress.com/2016/04/18/is-replicability-report-ego-depletionreplicability-report-of-165-ego-depletion-articles/  
\[3\] The introduction to his theory was published in 1987 in the form of a book with the title “Social Systems” and the book series number “666.” Those who were not aware of his note-taking system might have been tempted to think that this was not by chance, as his productivity could only have been explained by a deal with the devil.

\[7\] This problem is known as Meno’s paradox (Plato, Meno 80e, Grube translation).  
\[8\] SQ3R is the acronym for “Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review,” developed by psychology professor Francis Pleasant Robinson for the U.S. Army during World War II (Robinson, 1978).

\[16\] And, of course, it is addressing the “fear of the blank page” (Kruse 2005).  
\[17\] Ryfe and Kemmelmeier not only show that this development goes much further back into the past and first appeared in newspapers (the quotes of politicians got almost halved between 1892 and 1968), but also posed the question if this can maybe also be seen as a form of increased  professionalism of the media as they do not just let politicians talk as they wish (Ryfe and Kemmelmeier 2011). Craig Fehrman also pointed out the irony in the reception of this rather nuanced study – it was itself reduced to a soundbite in the media (Fehrman 2011).  
\[18\] As much as Csikszentmihalyi’s concept of flow became part of everyday language, it was never thoroughly examined. In the 1960’s, some studies in the Soviet Union focused on “postvoluntary  attention,” which basically means the same thing – an attention without effort that is neither  involuntary nor voluntary. But almost all of the study results are only available in Russian and never found their way into the international psychological discourse. (Cf. Bruya 2010, 4 with reference to Dobrynin 1966).  
\[19\] Flyvbjerg describes this experiment and example not only with reference to the book of Dreyfus  and Dreyfus, but also with reference to extensive talks with them. I therefore stick with the description in Flyvbjerg 2001.  
\[20\] This is even true for highly specialised surgeons (Gawande 2002).

\[22\] It is almost impossible to overstate the importance of taking care of the little things. Not only are  we easily distracted by mundane thoughts, we also routinely forget small but important things when  we don’t externalise them. This is why checklists are so important wherever something serious is at  stake (cf. Gawande 2010).  
\[23\] Even though this is not a new discovery, it is now confirmed by neuroscientists and experimental  psychologists alike (Doyle and Zakrajsek 2013 ref. Tambini, A., Ketz, N., and Davachi, L. 2010).  
\[24\] Neuroscientists would call it long-term potentiation (Bliss, Collingridge, and Morris 2004).  
\[25\] There is plenty of proof that sleeping aids in memorization (cf. for example Wagner et al. 2004)

\[38\] You can avoid that, though, by letting all members brainstorm for themselves and compiling the  results afterwards.  
\[39\] If that doesn’t convince you, then maybe the fact that the feeling of being in control lengthens  your life (Langer and Rodin 1976; Rodin and Langer 1977). That is equally as well understood as  the opposite: The loss of control has a negative effect on your health (M. G. Marmot et al. 1997).  As a short overview, cf. Michael G. Marmot 2006.

\[42\] The quote is variably attributed to William Faulkner, Allen Ginsberg, Oscar Wilde, Stephen  King and others. It seems that the critic Arthur Quiller-Couch mentioned it first when he told his  students at Cambridge in 1914: “If you here require a practical rule of me, I will present you with this: Whenever you feel an impulse to perpetrate a piece of exceptionally fine writing, obey it— wholeheartedly—and delete it before sending your manuscript to press. Murder your darlings.” (Quiller-Couch 2006, 203)
